I’m the type of player that only cares about aiming and therefore I’ve seeked out the best people known for aiming and I’ve asked what they do and thought out exercises and special training techniques to improve. Many of you reading this will not know me and that’s perfectly fine. Take my guide with a grain of salt, this is what I do and I’m sharing it with other people. I’m not saying this is the correct way to do certain things but I like to think that I’ve given it a little more thought than the average guide out there. This is what I’ve learned over the past few years going as in depth as possible.\r\n\r\nI’ve seeked out the best people known for aiming, Area, Roca, Scream, Device, Shroud and many more, and I’ve asked what they do for warming up and improving their aim, and I’ve thought out exercises and special training techniques to improve based on the information.\r\n\r\n# Contents\r\n## Mouse configuration\r\n    CPI / DPI\r\n    Windows sensitivity\r\n    In-game\r\n    Choosing a mouse\r\n    Grip\r\n\r\n## Myths\r\n    Acceleration\r\n    Rawinput – M_Rawinput\r\n    Mark C\r\n\r\n## What is aiming?\r\n    Flicking\r\n    Tracing\r\n    Preaim\r\n    Movement\r\n\r\n## Training\r\n    Good maps\r\n    Deathmatch servers\r\n\r\n## Annex\r\n    Raw input test\r\n    Useful links\r\n\r\n# Mouse configuration\r\n## CPI / DPI\r\n\r\nDPI stands for Dots per Inch, while CPI stands for Counts per Inch. CPI or DPI is a way for the mouse to track length. Note that they are different attributes of a sensor but in common context is virtually interchangeable. It is a part of what some refer to as ‘Real sensitivity’.\r\nDPI * in-game sensitivity * Windows sensitivity = real sensitivity.\r\n\r\n## Windows sensitivity\r\n\r\nWindows sensitivity is a multiplier to the DPI of the mouse. Below is a table of what each notch does. The default setting is 6/11, and is advised to use for optimal performance.\r\n\r\n6/11 is not ‘better’ it is more consistent and easier for the computer to handle without skipping anything, that said, some are still better than others to use.\r\n![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Below is a table of the different notches:\r\n\r\n1/11  = 0.03125 (sub optimal)\r\n2/11  = 0.0625  (sub optimal)\r\n3/11  = 0.25    (sub optimal)\r\n4/11  = 0.5     (sub optimal)\r\n5/11  = 0.75    (every 4th count is ignored = inconsistent)\r\n6/11  = 1.0     (optimal setting)\r\n7/11  = 1.5     (every 2nd count registers as 2 counts of movement = inconsistent + unit skipping)\r\n8/11  = 2.0     (unit skipping)\r\n9/11  = 2.5     (inconsistent + unit skipping)\r\n10/11 = 3.0     (unit skipping)\r\n11/11 = 3.5     (inconsistent + unit skipping)\r\n\r\n# In-game\r\n\r\nIn-game the sensitivity is a multiplier of windows + dpi. With rawinput (more information about rawinput down below) on the game will ignore the windows sensitivity, and act like it is set to 6/11, since it is 1:1. If you are unsure on using rawinput or not, then try and decide on what feels best.\r\n\r\nNote that you can apply acceleration to your game through the in-game settings for keyboard & mouse, or by a third party program if this is what you want. It is advised to play without acceleration on, but everything is subjective.\r\nI suggest staying away from acceleration in-game since it is tied to the current FPS.\r\n\r\n# Choosing a mouse\r\n\r\nAmbidextrous and ergonomic, there really are not cons or pros to ambidextrous and ergonomic, it is preference. Ambidextrous means you can use the mouse with your right or left hand with no discomfort .With ergonomic mice they are only designed for a certain hand (I.E Left or right hand.)\r\n\r\n# Grip\r\n\r\nThe way you’re holding the mouse is called mouse-grip, this is useful to know when you’re looking for a new mouse. We have 3 different types of grip:\r\n\r\n·Palm\r\n·Claw\r\n·Fingertip\r\n\r\nPalm grip, this grip used more commonly for ergonomic or larger mice. The user rests the entire palm on the mouse as well as the fingers\r\n\r\nClaw grip is used for medium sized mice. The user holds the mouse with the fingertips and the base of the palm for support.\r\n\r\nFingertip grip is used for small mice. The user only holds the mouse with the fingertips which can lead to fatigue, be aware of that.\r\n\r\nRefer to the photo for more info\r\n![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)\r\n\r\n# Myths\r\n## Acceleration\r\n\r\nGenerally in CS:GO, acceleration is considered bad, the argument is that it makes mouse movement inconsistent. Acceleration applies a filter to the mouse movement that changes its speed depending on how fast the mouse is moving. This makes it so you can change how much you’re turning with flicks. The acceleration filter in CS:GO is inconsistent, because the FPS is inconsistent. Even if you can achieve a stable FPS it is bound to drop at points therefore making it inconsistent. If you want to use acceleration I suggest using a third party application such as QL mouse filter. I personally believe you can be better with acceleration, but it takes longer and requires more effort. It is possible to have low sensitivity and still have the maneuverability from the higher ranges.\r\n\r\n## Rawinput – M_Rawinput\r\nRawinput is used to make the game take information from the mouse and bypassing the OS. Some people believe rawinput is bugged in CS:GO and this question still remains unanswered. Recent tests have showed it to be bugged, but still no confirmation from Valve about this issue.\r\nTest provided in annex.\r\n\r\nIn-depth explanation of Rawinput – Rawinput 0 resets the mouse cursor to the middle of the screen once every frame, higher FPS gives more resets, therefore better feel. Rawinput 1 makes CS:GO asks the Operating System which pointing device is being used and resets the cursor position as often as the polling rate allows it. If you aren't using Rawinput 1, I suggest capping your fps for more consistency. Rawinput is static no matter the fps.\r\n\r\n## Mark C\r\nThis mouse fix is for old games. Windows’ own acceleration curve (Enhanced Pointer Precision) would be applied in older games because the engine was trash, this fixes the curve so it always results in 0 acceleration. The old engines applied this acceleration by a mistake and newer engines and games do not have this mistake. Having this fix or not should make no difference.\r\n\r\n# What is aiming?\r\n## Flicking\r\nReactionary aim. Flicking is moving your mouse at a very fast speed to hit an enemy. You flick to the enemies that came as a surprise, perhaps flanked you or similar. This is mainly built on muscle memory and will be the difference from a great and a good player.\r\n\r\n## Tracing\r\nTracing or tracking is mainly used with pistols and spraying. If you are good at tracing, your crosshair will never leave the enemies head unless they go behind cover, in which case, pre aim kicks in and takes over. This is a mix of reaction and hand-eye coordination. It is determined by your own movement as well as the enemy’s which you’re tracking.\r\n\r\n## Preaim\r\nThis comes from deathmatch and experience, having your crosshair ready for the enemies to appear will eliminate travel time and thus reduce reaction time and it’s more consistent than always flicking to the enemies.\r\n\r\n## Movement\r\nIn most cases you have to adjust with your own movement to either counter the opponent's movement or to adjust your own mistake. It’s important to practice stutter stepping and peeking around corners properly.\r\n\r\nBeing in a position where you are exposed to 1 angle, or as few as possible, will help you focus on that one angle where the enemies could come. Peeking for information is also recommended, and then adjusting your aim afterwards to the new information, making you hit the opponent when peeking around the corner, without moving your mouse.\r\n\r\n# Training\r\nTraining should have focus points instead of being mindless, Deathmatch is pointless since all the angles are wrong, the situations is wrong. Its only purpose is to warm up, not to practice your aim.\r\n\r\nMain focus point while wanting to improve aim:\r\n·Tracking\r\n·Flicking\r\n·Muscle memory\r\n·Preaim\r\n\r\nWhen you’re practicing you need to concentrate on key points instead of just doing it, it’ll do nothing if you don’t focus on areas you want to improve upon.\r\n\r\nThese things are what makes your aim good. If you want to improve you have to push your own limits.\r\n\r\nAim_training_v2x is good for building muscle memory by flicking.\r\nSettings to use:\r\nClassic fast aim - size 12 delay 0.25 duration 0.50 targets 100 (These are the advanced settings and have been advertised by people like Friberg.)\r\n\r\nAim_botz is good for flicking and tracing.\r\n\r\n Block off 3 out of 4 sections. Flick from 1 bot to the next and attempt to be as fast as possible while still maintaining accuracy. Don’t go faster than you can. Noclip out of the middle box and run around the bots holding your crosshair on their head while jumping and crouching.\r\n\r\nAimtraindriving is good for tracing. Follow the bots’ heads around for a second or two before killing them. Make sure to enable god mode with ‘god’ in console.\r\n\r\nrecoil_master if you want to practice recoil, I don’t... It is very self-explanatory.\r\n\r\nGood maps\r\n\r\nAim_training_v2x               https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=135268414\r\n\r\nAim_botz                            https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=243702660\r\n\r\nAimtraindriving                   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=368026786\r\n\r\nAim_map                            http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=122443683\r\n\r\nRecoil_master                    https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=419404847\r\n\r\nDeathmatch servers:\r\n\r\nHSDM (NA) - 192.223.30.162:27015   (FRAGSHACK)\r\n                       23.19.172.136:27015     (NETCODE)\r\n                      104.156.231.219:27015  (GRAYMANN)\r\n                      108.61.119.189:27015    (GRAYMAN)                       \r\n                      162.251.167.85:27015    (IEPIC)\r\n\r\nHSDM (EU) -77.111.200.10:27015      (TITAN)\r\n                      83.141.26.173:27015      (NIP)\r\n                      94.249.140.41:27015      (GS-SYNDICATE)\r\n                      188.126.81.69:27015      (BRUTAL CS)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor NA FFA DM - 1V1 - Simply search up Fragshack for FFA, For 1V1 search up AM / 1V1.\r\nFor EU FFA DM - 1V1 - Simply search up Brutal CS, NIP, Titan, Nayu, For 1V1 search up AM / 1V1\r\n\r\n# Useful links\r\n\r\nhttp://www.overclock.net/t/173255/cs-s-mouse-optimization-guide\r\n\r\nhttp://www.overclock.net/t/1251156/an-overview-of-mouse-technology\r\n\r\nMice using flawless sensors https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZzbKDmFOqsP_ut2RdctD01OEbZzbXol6HLwqVkSmZcg/edit#gid=0","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
